Dependancies:

We used python for implementation.
No external dependencies as only standard modules are used.<br>
1.Python<br>
2.PIL(Python Image Library)<br>
3.math, time, sys, operator modules are used.

Design:

 We find similarity like Rotation,Scaling,Mirriong etc and we also provide a percentage of similarity. We find Root Mean Square value histogram difference and convert it into Percentage of similarity
